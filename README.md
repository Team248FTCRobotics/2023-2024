## NOTICE

This repository contains the Team 248 FTC SDK for the CENTERSTAGE (2023-2024) competition season.

## Welcome!
This GitHub repository contains the source code that is used to build an Android app to control a *FIRST* Tech Challenge competition robot.  To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.

## How to push new changes in Android Studio: <br>
Go to View -> Tool Windows -> Terminal <br>
Enter the following: <br>
git status        # Check the status of your working directory <br>
git add .         # Stage all changes (or specify files to stage) <br>
git commit        # Open text editor to write a commit message <br>
<br>
OR
<br>
<br>
git commit -m "Your commit message here"  # Commit with a message from the command line <br>
git push origin master         # Push changes to the remote repository (optional) <br>

## Requirements
To use this Android Studio project, you will need Android Studio 2021.3.1 (codename Dolphin) or later.

## Downloading the Project
If you are an Android Studio programmer, there are several ways to download this repo.  Note that if you use the Blocks or OnBot Java Tool to program your robot, then you do not need to download this repository.

* If you are a git user, you can clone the most current version of the repository:

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;git clone https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController.git</p>

* Or, if you prefer, you can use the "Download Zip" button available through the main repository page.  Downloading the project as a .ZIP file will keep the size of the download manageable.

* You can also download the project folder (as a .zip or .tar.gz archive file) from the Downloads subsection of the [Releases](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController/releases) page for this repository.

* The Releases page also contains prebuilt APKs.

Once you have downloaded and uncompressed (if needed) your folder, you can use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").
